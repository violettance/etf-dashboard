# Which ETF?

An ETF comparison dashboard by Violettance. It turns a broad US-listed fund
universe into a shortlist, then helps compare fees, assets, liquidity, yield,
and historical returns. Every market snapshot is labelled with its source and
capture date; missing fees are shown as unverified rather than guessed.

The interface is a portfolio example of decision-focused data design. It does
not recommend funds or provide investment advice.

## What it does

- **Overview:** puts market concentration, return weighting, liquidity, and
  category-level patterns ahead of a raw fund-count summary.
- **Screener:** searches by symbol, fund name, and issuer; filters by category,
  assets, yield, and verified fee; supports sorting and pagination.
- **Compare:** lines up as many as four funds and shows the differences that
  matter for similar products.
- **Fund detail:** fetches daily price history from Stooq and derives return,
  volatility, drawdown, and Sharpe metrics. It also shows the dated snapshot
  figures and verified issuer-published fees where available.
- **Category analysis:** compares median returns for categories with enough
  qualifying funds.
- **Top performers and risk-return:** ranks funds by return or yield and shows
  3-year against 5-year patterns, excluding leveraged, inverse, and smaller
  funds where relevant.
- **News sentiment:** displays topic-level Alpha Vantage results when an API
  key is configured.

## Data and limitations

The directory contains 4,148 funds from Yahoo Finance via yfinance, captured
on **May 25, 2025**. Its assets, yield, volume, and return fields are historical
and should not be treated as current market data. The dashboard displays the
snapshot age wherever those fields appear. Fund detail pages request daily
history from Stooq separately; that request can be unavailable for some
symbols or at some times.

Expense ratios are issuer-published values verified by hand for a subset of
commonly compared funds. Other rows show `n/a`. The news view requires an
Alpha Vantage key. There are no user accounts or personalized recommendations.

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js 20.9 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/violettance/etf-dashboard.git
cd etf-dashboard
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. The screener and historical directory work
without API keys. To enable news sentiment, copy `.env.example` to
`.env.local` and set `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY`. Keys are read on the server only.

## Checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test -- --run
npm run build
```
