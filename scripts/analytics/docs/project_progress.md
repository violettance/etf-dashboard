### Important Decisions
- **Virtual Page Views**: Decided to use for SPA tab tracking ✅ Implemented
- **GTM vs Direct GA4**: GTM chosen for better tag management ✅ Implemented
- **Testing Strategy**: GTM Preview + GA4 DebugView combination
- **Next.js Script Component**: Used for optimal GTM loading performance
- **Package Manager**: Using pnpm (v10.11.0) as indicated by pnpm-lock.yaml
- **API Configuration**: Direct API approach successful for GA4 setup
- **Security First**: Environment variables for all sensitive data ✅ Implemented

### Lessons Learned
- **CRITICAL**: Project documentation was completely inaccurate regarding environment setup
- Development environment requires proper installation sequence: Homebrew → Node.js → npm → pnpm
- Next.js Script component with `afterInteractive` strategy works well for GTM
- TypeScript declarations needed for window.dataLayer and window.gtag
- Virtual page view tracking essential for SPA tab navigation
- Client-side checks (`typeof window !== 'undefined'`) prevent SSR issues
- **Component-level tracking**: All tracking functions work seamlessly with React event handlers
- **API Integration**: Google Analytics Admin API provides powerful automation capabilities
- **Environment Variables**: Secure credential management essential for production
- **GTM Preview Mode**: Requires proper environment variable setup and dataLayer initialization
- **Security**: Never log sensitive IDs - use environment variables and validation

### Implementation Details Completed
1. **Development Environment**: ✅ FULLY RESOLVED - All tools installed and working
2. **GTM Snippet**: ✅ SECURED - Environment variables, proper dataLayer init
3. **Data Layer**: Initialized with safety checks for SSR compatibility

3. **Priya Sharma**: Complete manual GA4 settings (user properties, conversions, data retention)
4. **Priya Sharma**: Create GA4 reports and funnels
5. **Team**: Cross-device testing and performance validation

### Outstanding Manual Tasks
